/** An "Unlikely lock" is a lock which normally any number of threads can access
    concurrently, but when locked, all threads must exit and never reenter.

    This is implemented as a simple counting semaphore that starts at zero. Any
    thread can acquire by adding one to the semaphore. If a thread discovers that the
    semaphore was over a threshold (100000), it decrements again and returns false.

    Thus, the lock can be acquired by adding 100000 to the atomic member, and waiting until
    the atomic member's value drops to exactly 100000, at which point all threads will have
    exited.
