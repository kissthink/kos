 *  A Service is a method through which a certain component of the system

 *  requiring any knowledge of the internals of the component.
 *
 *  An example of the use of a Service is the partitioner, which can be
 *  notified of Disk changes (LoDisk, plug & play, hotplug drives) and
 *  update the partition tree accordingly.
