Intel Vol1: 6.4.6 Interrupt and Exception Behaviour in 64-bit Mode
------------------------------------------------------------
- all interrupt handlers pointed by IDT is 64-bit code
- size of interrupt stack pushes is fixed at 64-bit
- stack pointer (SS:RSP) is pushed unconditionally on interrupts
- new SS is set to NULL if CPL changes
- IRET behaviour changed
- interrupt stack-switch mechanism changed
- alignment of interrupt stack frame is changed

Intel Vol3: 6.14.3 IRET in IA-32e mode
-------------------------------------- 
- IRET pops SS:RSP unconditionally off the interrupt stack frame only when executed in 64-bit mode
- if in 64-bit mode and target CPL for IRET is <> 3, SS is allowed to be set to NULL

Intel Vol3: 6.14.4 Stack switching in IA-32e mode
-------------------------------------------------
- a stack switch in IA-32e mode works like the legacy stack switch, except new SS selector is set to NULL
- old SS and RSP are saved on the new stack and restored on subsequent IRET
---------
SS    +40
---------
RSP   +32
---------
RFLAGS+24
---------
CS    +16
---------
RIP   +8
---------
ErrorCode       <-- RSP points to here in interrupt handler

Commands Supported
------------------
qSupported: Report the features supported by the RSP (remote serial protocol) server.
            As a minimum, just the packet size can be reported.

qC:         Report the current thread. (return an empty response for this barebone implementation)

qAttached:  Not used.

qOffsets:   Report the offsets to use when relocating downloaded code.
            As a minimum, return "Text=0;Data=0;Bss=0"

qSymbol::   Request any symbol table data.
            A minimum implementation should return no data. (return "OK")

qTStatus    Ask the stub if there is a trace experiement running right now.
            Return 'T0' for not running (from documentation) But, empty response works actually.

Hc-1:       Do future step/continue operations work on all threads?
            As a minimum, return "OK"

Hc0:        ???
            Return OK

Hg-1:       All other future operations should apply to all threads.
            As a minimum, return "OK"

Hg0:        ???
            Return OK
