Cross Compilation Environment
=============================

To prepare the cross compilation environment, adjust the first few lines of
'setup_crossenv.sh' and 'config'.  You will need to download the appropriate
source packages from your friendly neighbourhood mirror.

IMPORTANT: To build the cross compiler, you must have the *development*
versions (i.e., libraries *and* headers) of the following packages installed
that are appropriate for your host compiler:
- GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library 'gmp' (http://gmplib.org/)
- GNU MPC 'mpc' or 'libmpc' (http://www.multiprecision.org/)
- GNU MPFR 'mpfr' (http://www.mpfr.org/)
- CLooG Code Generator 'cloog' (http://www.cloog.org/) and dependencies:
  . Integer Set Library 'isl' (http://garage.kotnet.org/~skimo/isl/), or
  . Parma Polyhedra Library 'ppl' (http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/)

Building the cross compiler requires several other packages, such as flex,
bison, gtk, ncurses (for gdb), but these should typically be present on
systems configured for software development.

The output of the cross compilation script should contain the following
(among other output; grep for SUCCESS):

SUCCESS: gcc-4.7.2 install
SUCCESS: grub-2.00 install
SUCCESS: gdb-7.5.1 install
SUCCESS: libelf-0.8.13 install


Hardware Emulation
==================

The script setup_crossenv.sh also contains suggested configurations for
bochs and qemu and will build and install those in $TOOLSDIR (default is
/usr/local) when invoked with the corresponding command-line argument.


Other Tools
===========

You need to have a somewhat recent version of xorriso (>-1.0.0) installed
for grub2 iso image making using grub-mkrescue. The package might also be
called 'libisoburn'.


Building KOS
============

To prepare the KOS source code (starting from the main directory):

cd src/extern

# download acpica-unix-20130328.tar.gz from https://www.acpica.org/downloads
tar xzvf acpica-unix-20130328.tar.gz
cd acpica-unix-20130328
patch -p1 < ../../../patches/acpica.patch
cd ..
mv acpica-unix-20130328 acpica
cd ../..

You should be back in the main directory. Type 'make' to get a list of build
targets. These targets should also work from within the src/ directry.

Make sure to *not* have any of gcc's or ld's PATH environment variables set,
such as C_INCLUDE_PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH, since those might interfere with
the cross compiler setup.


Running KOS
===========

When executing KOS, the system should show a number of messages and then get
into a split-screen mode, where the first 20 lines are showing output from 7
threads running on 2 cores and the bottom 5 lines show keycodes when keys
are pressed and released.  Running KOS in qemu creates several log files
that can be used to diagnose problems:

/tmp/KOS.serial
/tmp/KOS.dbg
/tmp/qemu.log - disabled in Makefile.config (see -d option to qemu)

KOS.dbg and KOS.serial are two different output channels internally, but
currently contain essentially the same information.
