- header file ifdef -> same capitalization as file name
- optimize for maximum number of LOC on screen
  . conditionals with single statement -> same line
  . conditionals on one same line -> use brackets
    -> open bracket on same line as condition
  . no gratuitous empty lines (e.g. 2 empty lines)
- use constructor initialization
- try to fit comments on right hand side of code
- if tabs as spaces, tab space is 2

- types start with upper case, variables with lower case
  . use capitalization and/or underscore to mark words in names

- attend to all warnings!
